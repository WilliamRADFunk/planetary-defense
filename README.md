A small game, just for fun.</br></br>

Left and right arrow keys, or A and D keys, will rotate chosen ring counterclockwise and clockwise, respectively.</br></br>

Touching screen with one finger on left and right arrow keys, will rotate chosen ring counterclockwise and clockwise, respectively.</br></br>

Spacebar key will change active ring starting at inner-most ring, and working outward until starting back at inner-most ring.</br></br>

Touching screen with two fingers will change active ring starting at inner-most ring, and working outward until starting back at inner-most ring.</br></br>

Barriers are meant to block asteroids, and keep the center sphere (player) safe.</br></br>

When hit, barriers change colors from green to yellow to red. When a red barrier is hit, it's destroyed.</br></br>

Goal of the game is to stay alive (player sphere remains unscathed) for as long as possible.</br></br>

Score is determined by a timer. Every second alive adds a point to total score.

Floating blue spheres are the repair nodes. Contact a barrier to this, and it will repair.
